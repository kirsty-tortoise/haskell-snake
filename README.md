# SNAKE in Haskell

This is a snake game implemented using the programming language Haskell.

I wanted to learn Haskell and had been looking into Haskell at school but didn't have much time because of the silly exams, so when the exams were over I made this simple game in Haskell.

To compile the game, type "ghc snake.hs -optl-mwindows" into the terminal / command prompt, and it should magically make an executable file, hopefully.
